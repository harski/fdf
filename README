FDF - FIND DUPLICATE FILES
==========================

fdf finds duplicate file entries under the specified directory (recursively).
Determing if two files are actually the same file is based on file sha1 sums.
The first file found for each sha1 sum is considered the "original" file, and
the rest are output to stdout.

command

    $ make

To install fdf make sure to set the path correctly in Makefile and command
